# dotfiles

My collection of custom dotfiles. Dotfile installation management inspired by [Drew DeVault](https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html).

## Adding dotfiles to the repo

To add new customized dotfiles to the repo, from the home directory, run `git add -f <filename>`. This overrides the `*` in the `.gitignore` to track the dotfile you want to add.
